# NeuroCubeX

Welcome to MINT's 2022 NTX submission! Our project this year was NeuroCubeX, a project where we created a cube that's capable of rotating, expanding, and lighting up based on specific EEG inputs from the OpenBCI cyton board. 

## Steps to Reproduce:
The steps to reproduce our submission require 3d printing the necessary parts as well as combining all the electrical components necessary to build the eletrical components of the box. From the integration of the 3d printing to the electrical components, the Arduino needs to be programmed to take the inputs from the software to actually dynamically move the box and all it's components. The deep learning models, software and signal processing are all contained within this repo and can be run. 

To get a better sense of this project, you'll require an OpenBCI cyton board to record the inputs which can then be sent to the deep learning model from where the predictions can be sent to the box and used to create changes.
